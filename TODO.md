Idea:
Have a character that tries to escape as many chores as possible moving only in the y-axis.Chores will come at random speed 
in the x-axis (maybe even at random size) against the character.If an object does not hit the character, the score goes up
(formula for calculation will be determined in the future).There will be different chores:
-cleaning
-washing the dishes
-going for a walk with the dog
-studying
-doing the laundry
-going to the market
Each one will be represented by a picture.
(In the furure, doing things a procrastinator does, like playing videogames, meeting with friends, daydreaming, watching films will be added,
which the player will try to get in order to get a bigger score)
